# Admin Panel: User Management Mock-Up

This project is a mock-up of a user management page for an admin panel, designed as the first of several admin interface templates.

## Features

- Clean, responsive layout designed to align with the organizationâ€™s style and branding

- Fetches user data dynamically from a public API

- Displays user information with sorting functionality by ascending or descending order

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on frontend logic and user experience

## About

This was my initial contribution to the Building-U project, and it later served as a template for other admin panel pages. It was a great opportunity to work on both design and functionality, integrating API data with user interface controls.
